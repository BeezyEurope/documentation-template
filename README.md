# Beezy documentation

DocStrap is [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html) based template for [JSDoc3](http://usejsdoc.org/).
In addition, it includes all of the themes from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) giving you a great deal of look
and feel options for your documentation, along with a simple search. Additionally, it adds some options to the conf.json file that gives
you even more flexibility to tweak the template to your needs. It will also make your teeth whiter.
